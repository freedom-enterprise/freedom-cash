# Freedom Cash
ðŸ¦• module to stabilize the buy price and increase the sell price of [Freedom Cash](https://FreedomCash.org).

## Utility
Support peer to peer collaboration while preventing pump and dump frauds.  
Reduce dependency from exchanges by adding a buy and sell function within the [smart contract](https://github.com/monique-baumann/freedom-cash/blob/main/blockchain/freedom-cash.sol#L47-L58) itself.  
This allows to define a reasonable pricing algorithm and ensures that people do not need to waste gas-, liquidity provider- and exchange fees.   

## Usage Example

```ts
import { Bollinger } from "https://deno.land/x/freedom_cash/mod.ts";
import { sleep } from "https://deno.land/x/sleep/mod.ts";

const bollinger = await Bollinger.getInstance()

let repeatXMoreTimes = 9 
const minHistoryLength = 3
const factor = 3

while (repeatXMoreTimes > 0) {
    const randomNumber = Math.round((Math.random() * (81 - 9) + 9))
    bollinger.addToPriceHistory(randomNumber)
    const investmentDecision = bollinger.getInvestmentDecision(minHistoryLength, factor)
    console.log("O.K. I will:", investmentDecision)
    await sleep(9)
    repeatXMoreTimes--
}
```
