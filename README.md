# Freedom Cash
ðŸ¦• [module](https://deno.land/x/freedom_cash) to stabilize the buy price and increase the sell price of [Freedom Cash](https://FreedomCash.org).  

## Utility 
Support peer to peer collaboration while preventing pump and dump frauds.  
Reduce dependencies from exchanges by adding a [buy and sell function](https://github.com/monique-baumann/freedom-cash/blob/main/blockchain/freedom-cash.sol#L59-L71) within the [smart contract](https://github.com/monique-baumann/freedom-cash/blob/main/blockchain/freedom-cash.sol) itself.  
This allows to define a reasonable [pricing algorithm](https://github.com/monique-baumann/freedom-cash/blob/main/blockchain/freedom-cash.sol#L49-L58) and ensures that people do not need to waste gas-, liquidity provider- and exchange fees.

const sleepTimePerInterval = 3
const minHistoryLength = 3

await monique.play(sleepTimePerInterval, minHistoryLength, relevantHistoryLength, factor)
```

## Q&A 
<b>Why don't you create liquidity as an ETH/FreedomCash Tradingpair on Uniswap?</b>  
  
With our approach we reduce gas fees and avoid exchange fees for Freedom Cash investors.
Our pricing approach protects against ponzi like vulnerabilities & drops of the [sell price](https://github.com/monique-baumann/freedom-cash/blob/main/blockchain/freedom-cash.sol#L54-L58).


<b>What happens if anyone creates a liquidity pool for Freedom Cash on Uniswap?</b>  
  
People are free to create liquidity pools e.g. with ETH/FreedomCash liquidity on Uniswap. It is just not necessary and not useful.

<b>How is it possible that the sell price never drops?</b>  
  
The sell price of Freedom Cash expressed in Ether and sold via the smart contract can stay as it is or go up. It can never drop.
Please study the [smart contract](https://github.com/monique-baumann/freedom-cash/blob/main/blockchain/freedom-cash.sol) and focus on the [getSellPrice](https://github.com/monique-baumann/freedom-cash/blob/main/blockchain/freedom-cash.sol#L54-L58) function.
