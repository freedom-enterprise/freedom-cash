	<h2 class="text-center">Public Goods Funding</h2> 
	In times of international socialism, corrupt opportunistic politicians turned public goods funding to public bads funding. They funded weapons, propaganda and war in their attempt to divide and conquer.<p><br></p>
	They stole our assets and tried to enslave us with CBDCs, wars and laws which serve corruption and totalitarianism instead of free, strong, peaceloving, healthy, reasonable people like you and me. <p><br></p>
	
	We can and will do better than that.

	<h4>Gitcoin CULTDAO et al.</h4>
	Many pioneer groups like the <a href="https://www.gitcoin.co/" target="_blank">Gitcoin</a> community and the <a href="https://cultdao.io/" target="_blank">CULTDAO</a> 
	community paved the way to efficient, fun and fair decentralized public goods funding. <p><br></p>
	In these contexts it is common sense that we the people decide which public goods we fund. Not centralized, corrupt, warmongering, CBDC, divide and conquer propaganda people. 
<p><br></p>
	This is why we support Gitcoin, CULTDAO et al. for letting all of us fund what we love. 

<p><br></p>

	<h4>Direct Democracy</h4>
	Instead of accepting fake democracies we believe in real, direct democracies. <p><br></p>
	We trust the average of our neighbours more that we trust "politicians". <p><br></p> 
	We trust those who are interested in truth. <p><br></p> We distrust those who "are 100% sure" they have found it. <p><br></p>
	Corrupt, opportunistic politicians pretended they knew better than us. In reality most of us seem to know better than them.
	This is why we support <a href="https://otherparty.co.uk" target="_blank">otherparty.co.uk</a> for giving people back their own free, healthy mind, their wish to explore reality, their wish to do good for themselves and for everyone who gives freedom to everyone who gives freedom to everyone.
