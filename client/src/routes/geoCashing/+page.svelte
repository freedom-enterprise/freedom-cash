	<h2>Geocashing Wallets</h2>

	In times of totalitarian international socialism it seems important to prevent corrupt
	opportunistic politicians from stealing your investments.
	<p><br /></p>
	We encourage people to hide their assets at many different places. With this we support Freedom, Fairness,
	Love and Peace.
	<p><br /></p>
	Our money is free. So are we.

	<h4>Geocaching Goes Geocashing</h4>
	If you love freedom, you'll probably love the Games for Freedom Initiative.
	<p><br /></p>
	We invite you to play Geocashing. Let's explore together. Let's go.
	<h4>Basics</h4>
	<h6>Online Wallets</h6>
	<p><br /></p>

	Just like we can utilize a browser to browse the internet, we can utilize a wallet to interact
	with blockchains.
	<p><br /></p>

	For rather small amounts and in order to interact with blockchains and distributed Apps (dApps),
	it seems ok to use online wallets like
	<a href="https://metamask.io" target="_blank">metamask.io</a>
	and
	<a href="https://sonsofcrypto.com/" target="_blank">sonsofcrypto</a>.
	<p><br /></p>
	For rather big amounts of money and in order to collaborate peer to peer without corrupt and totalitarian
	surveillance people in between we shall rather use offline wallets like paperwallets etc.
	<p><br /><br /></p>

	<h6>Offline Wallets</h6>

	<p><br /></p>
	One of the best ways to store your crypto assets are self hosted (only you have the private key), cold
	(not connected to the internet) wallets. You can check the code of our paperwallet generator
	<a href="https://github.com/michael-spengler/paperwallet-generator" target="_blank">here</a>.
	<p><br /></p>
	This is a hobby project with the best of intentions. Please do your own research before moving huge
	amounts.

	<h4>Geocashing Token Economics</h4>

	As Freedom Lovers we generate paperwallets and hide them at beautiful places.
	<p><br /></p>
	We document that in a video on https://rumble.com. With that we hope to inspire further Freedom Lovers
	to fund the specific Geocash.
